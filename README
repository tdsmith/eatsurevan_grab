Hacked together real fast! 'Cause that's how we roll. Here are some scripts to scrape restaurant inspection data from the unfriendly Vancouver Coastal Health restaurant inspection website. (http://www.foodinspectionweb.vcha.ca/)

See it more or less in action at: http://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?snapid=112465 -- I recommend the map view, myself.

Things that you need:
1. Python 2.x
2. BeautifulSoup
3. A sense of adventure

Run them in this order:
1. python fetchandparselist.py > restos.tab
    Fetches and parses the entire list of restaurants from VCH. Creates
    restaurants.html. Outputs restos.tab, which is a tab-separated text file.
    It contains restaurant name, address, and date of last inspection.
    The last column is the relative URL to each restaurant's info page.
2. mkdir restos; python fetchrestos.py
    Fetches the restaurant info pages for each individual restaurant.
3. python parserestos.py
    Creates an index of inspections that have occurred, the date, and the type
    of inspection. Creates inspections.repr.

You could try running fetchinspections.py if you wanted. But I haven't tested
it. (mkdir inspections first.)

To generate the score reports we have now:
1. Modify restos.tab s.t. the last column is just the GUID portion of the URL.
    (Sorry.)
2. python score.py
    Generates scores.pickle, which contains a dictionary linking the restaurant
    GUID to the number of re-inspections noted recently on the VCH website
    (the "score").
3. python mkcsv.py
    Generates a CSV file suitable for upload to Google Fusion Tables. Creates
    (imaginitively) output.csv.

And that's where we are.
